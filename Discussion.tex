In this paper, we presented a research platform for autonomous picking and palletizing (APPLE) for
fully autonomous commissioning tasks in intralogistics settings. The APPLE robot comprises a
nonholonomic mobile base with the ability to autonomously detect and pick standard EUR half-pallets
from designated loading areas. Also incorporated is a camera system for the detection and avoidance
of human workers wearing reflective safety clothing. The manipulation system for loading/unloading
unstructured goods from pallets operates on a novel redundant grasp representation as intervals in
task space, which allows to incorporate empirical knowledge. We leverage the obtained redundancy by
generating reactive manipulator motions on the fly, by using a prioritized control approach which
allows to formulate the target object picking as a stack of hierarchical tasks~\cite{Kano11}. Also,
we provide an early experimental evaluation of the APPLE system by means of successfully executed
trials of a simplified commissioning task (see the video attachment).

The presented work is limited to the picking of objects with cylindrical shapes, future work will
aim at extending our grasp interval representation to other primitive shape types. Also, we work on
a computational method to parametrize the interval for a current scene which, right now, is done
empirically.
