\subsection{Navigation}
\label{subsec:navigation}
%
This module ensures that the AGV is capable to move autonomously and safely through the workspace
environment. In order to achieve this task, we use components of a navigation system previously
developed in the context of our KKS-funded Safe Autonomous Vehicles (SAUNA) project. We construct a
3D map of the static parts of the environment (using~\cite{Stoy13}) and use it to localize the
vehicle in the presence of dynamic entities (using~\cite{Vale14}). For motion planning and control
of the non-holonomic AGV, we will our lattice planner~\cite{Ciri14} and a model-predictive tracking
controller. The complete navigation system has been implemented, extensively tested and successfully
integrated on the APPLE demonstrator, a detailed description can be found in~\cite{Andr15}.

\subsection{People Detection}
\label{subsec:people_det}
%
As the envisioned mobile manipulation system will operate in environments shared with human workers,
people detection and human safety are important issues. In APPLE we address the problem by using the
RefleX system we recently developed~\cite{Mosb14}. RefleX is a camera-based on-board safety system
for industrial vehicles and machinery for detection of human workers wearing reflective vests worn
as per safety regulations. The system was designed with industrial safety standards in mind and is
currently being tested as an industrial prototype.
