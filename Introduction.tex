The increasing need for fast and flexible commissioning ($i.\,e.,$ order picking and collection of
unstructured goods from storage compartments in warehouses) in logistic scenarios has created
substantial interest for autonomous robotic solutions. One of the main arguments for automating this
task is that the dull and strenuous nature of commissioning could cause mental and physical illness
in human workers. As a result, the determination within the logistics sector to invest in this area
is high and substantial efforts are made for the humanization of workstations~\cite{Eche08}.

For controlled environments there exist partial solutions for the automated commissioning
problem. The system described in~\cite{Wurm08} coordinates a fleet of Autonomous Ground Vehicles
(AGVs) which transport shelves filled with goods to a human worker who picks the corresponding objects
to complete the order. Key obstacles for a fully automatized solution applicable in general
warehouse settings are the safe autonomous vehicle navigation in industrial environments
co-populated by humans, as well as the autonomous grasping/manipulation of unstructured goods at
reasonable cycle times.

In this work, we present the Autonomous Picking \& Palletizing (APPLE) research platform (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:robot}) which we developed to address the following important sub-task chain which
occurs during commissioning in prototypical warehouses: autonomous picking of goods from a storage
location, subsequent placement on a standard EUR half-pallet and transport of the filled pallet to a
target location. Furthermore, this process has to be carried out in a manner which is safe for
humans operating in the same environment. The platform's mobile base consists of a non-holonomic
forklift AGV which is able to detect and pick up pallets in designated loading zones \hl{@Henrik: is
  that a reasonable one-sentence description...?}. A KUKA LBR iiwa leight-weight arm which is fitted
with an under-actuated gripper with conveyor belts on the inside of each finger is used for robust
grasping and object manipulation. While this setup is not intended as a close-to-market solution for
palletizing, the force/torque sensing capabilities as well as the compliant and human-safe control
possibilities allow us to investigate various grasping/manipulation strategies.

\caption{\textit{The APPLE platform:} A KUKA LBR iiwa arm (3) is mounted on a retrofitted Linde
  CitiTruck AGV (6). For localization, a Velodyne Lidar (4) is used, human worker detection is
  carried out with the RefleX camera system (5). The depicted grasping device (2) is a further
  developed and smaller version of the Velvet Fingers gripper described in~\cite{Tinc12}. Each of
  the gripper’s two fingers has a planar manipulator structure with two rotary joints and active
  surfaces which are implemented by conveyor belts on the inside of the two phalanges. The
  mechanical structure of each finger is underactuated and comprises one actuated Degree of Freedom
  (DoF) for opening and closing and two DoF for the belt movements. If, during grasping, the
  proximal phalanges are blocked by an object, the gripper’s distal phalanges continue to “wrap
  around” and envelope it in a firm grasp. Object and pallet detection is done with an ASUS Xtion
  Pro camera (1) which is mounted on the gripper's palm.}

In this paper, we outline our solution to the safe navigation of the APPLE platform in an industrial
scenario co-populated by human workers wearing reflective vests. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
grasp planning- and representation scheme which is utilized for reactive, on-the-fly manipulator
motion generation. This allows to exploit manipulator redundancies and offers several advantages to
the commonly used sense-plan-act architectures. As a final contribution, we discuss our compliant
grasp execution strategy which uses the active surfaces on the gripper to increase grasp robustness.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: below we outline the AGV navigation and
motion planning scheme before presenting our solution for people detection in
Section~\ref{subsec:AGV_related_work}. In Section~\ref{sec:manip} our approach to robust, online
grasp motion generation and grasp execution is discussed. We show early results and an evaluation of
the APPLE system by means on a simplified commissioning task in Section~\ref{sec:eval} before
drawing conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
